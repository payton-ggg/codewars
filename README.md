# 🥋 Codewars Solutions

Welcome to my Codewars Kata archive! This repository contains my solutions to various programming challenges (aka "katas") from [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/). It's a growing collection of my personal learning journey and code practice across multiple difficulty levels and topics.

## 🚀 Purpose

- 📚 Improve problem-solving and algorithmic thinking
- 💡 Explore clean code and multiple solution approaches
- 🛠️ Practice JavaScript (and possibly other languages in the future)
- 🧠 Track progress and stay consistent

## 🧩 Structure

```bash
.
├── 8kyu/
│   ├── kata-name.js
├── 7kyu/
│   ├── kata-name.js
├── 6kyu/
│   ├── kata-name.js
├── ...
├── init.js
└── README.md
```

Each folder corresponds to the kata difficulty level. Filenames usually match the kata's title in kebab-case format.
